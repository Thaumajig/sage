## README
SAGE (Semantic Annotation by Group Exploration) is a web application that allows the relationships between items in a collection of resources to be discovered, captured and explored. SAGE uses the SAGA algorithm (Semantically Annotated Graph Analysis) to detect these similarities, and can be customised with additional similarity measures for other research projects. Algorithms can then be compared with one another using SAGE's evaluation modules.

## About
SAGE was developed as part of the PhD candidature of Jacob Foley at the [University of New England](http://www.une.edu.au/) in New South Wales, Australia. This project was supervised by Associate Professor Paul Kwan and Dr. Mitchell Welch, and was conducted in collaboration with William Oates of the [UNE Heritage Centre](http://www.une.edu.au/library/heritage-centre). The aim of this research was to apply and evaluate multiagent computing techniques to the field of digital heritage, and develop a specialised algorithm with characteristics appropriate to this application area.

## Instructions
The [wiki](https://github.com/jacobjfoley/sage/wiki) for this project contains information on setting up and using SAGE. SAGE can be run on your own system, but you'll need an Amazon and Google Developer account in order to configure S3 thumbnail storage and Google Drive integration.

## Licence
SAGE and SAGA are licensed under the MIT Licence. Contributions to the project are welcome.
