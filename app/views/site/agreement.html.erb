  <h3>Research Project</h3>

  <p>Semantic Annotation of Digital Objects by Multiagent Computing: Applications in Digital Cultural Heritage</p>

  <h3>Aim of the research</h3>

  <p>The research explores the application a novel computer algorithm for finding links between separate elements of knowledge.
    Participants are asked to contribute their observations about a collection of photographs as information for the algorithm to utilise.
    The algorithm attempts to determine likely associations between photographs and known knowledge, and suggests these association to the user.
    Annotations and associations are contributed and viewed in a simple web application (SAGE) available on any internet-connected computer with a web browser.
    This research is being applied as a case study to a collection of digital heritage photographs from the UNE Heritage Centre.
