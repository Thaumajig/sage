<h1>Tester Information </h1>
<p>The following information is super duper top secret information for the testers who are evaluating SAGE. </p>
<h3>Tester Survey </h3>
<p>Please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WuxK3Ix2ViPIXC-bHqH4aesjtQYF8Q6vtFuUW1Vjj5U/viewform" target="_blank"> this survey </a> once you've learned how to use SAGE and have had a chance to test it out on one of the sample collections. </p>
<h3>Sample Key </h3>
<p>You can repeatedly redeem the key <strong> abcdefghijklmnop </strong> to be allocated a collection of images to annotate for science. The more samples you can complete, the better. An even number of samples is preferable for analysis.</p>
<h3>Thanks Again!</h3>
<p>Thank you once again for taking part in this project. In return for your help, if you think that SAGE might be of use to you, you are more than welcome to use it for your own personal projects.</p>
